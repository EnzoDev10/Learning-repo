## How to Make successfull projects

### Understand the problem
To understand a problem better try rewording it in plain english(or spanish) until it makes sense. 

### Plan
Whenever you´re trying to build something ask some of this questions:

- How does the interface of the project should look like?
- What kind of functionalities should it have?
- What do the project needs to work appropriately?
- What does the user needs to do in order to work? 
- What's the desired output?
- What are the steps necessary to return the desired output?  

### Divide and Conquer

Divide the project into smaller parts that can be worked on individually.

### Pseudocode / Algorithm
Once you´re done you should try and create instructions to achieve each small part. It´s not necessary to make instructions for all parts right away, it´s better to write them as you need to develop them.
If you are not sure on how to do a certain task, write down a note below the instructions as a remainder to look it up later.
